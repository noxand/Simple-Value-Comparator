# Simple Value Comparator
This is one of the task of Pirple Python is Easy online course.

The task is to create a function that accepts 3 parameters and checks for equality between any two of them. The function should return True if 2 or more of the parameters are equal, and false is none of them are equal to any of the others.

Modify the function so that strings can be compared to integers if they are equivalent. For example, if the following values are passed to your function:

```
6,5,"5"
